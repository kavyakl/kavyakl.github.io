source_text: 'I led research on compiler-inspired dynamic sparsity optimization for
  CNNs targeting edge deployment. The system utilized a 5-stage transformation pipeline:
  (1) baseline dense models, (2) RigL-based sparse training with Grad-CAM-based interpretability
  pruning, (3) BatchNorm operator fusion, (4) quantized sparse compression using CSR/COO
  and FP16, and (5) ONNX export for runtime deployment. Across datasets like MNIST
  and CIFAR-10, we achieved over 90% sparsity with minimal accuracy loss. I also built
  real-time metrics for monitoring FLOPs and memory footprint, enabling precise profiling.
  The full pipeline was validated through ablation studies and represents a step forward
  in reproducible, automated CNN compression tailored for real-time and edge AI systems.'
