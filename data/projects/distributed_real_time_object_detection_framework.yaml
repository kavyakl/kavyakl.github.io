source_text: I developed and deployed a distributed real-time object detection system
  using Binarized Neural Networks (BNNs) running on PYNQ-Z1 FPGA-based edge devices.
  The system utilized a wireless communication mesh among three nodes and leveraged
  heterogeneous computing for fast, on-device image classification. I designed the
  inference pipeline for optimal throughput under memory and latency constraints,
  implemented communication synchronization protocols, and benchmarked the system
  across varying node counts. The framework achieved 19.23 FPS, demonstrating near-linear
  speedup with additional nodes and low communication overhead. Published at IEEE
  iSES 2020, this project demonstrates scalable, energy-efficient AI for constrained
  edge devices in domains like smart cities and autonomous sensing.
