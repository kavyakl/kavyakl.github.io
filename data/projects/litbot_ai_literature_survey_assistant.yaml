title: 'LitBot: AI Literature Survey Assistant'
slug: litbot
description: Developed LitBot, a GPT + FAISS-powered AI assistant for automating literature
  surveys, semantic search, and citation analysis across 200+ research papers, streamlining
  academic workflows.
role: Developer
technologies:
- OpenAI GPT models
- FAISS vector search
- PyMuPDF PDF processing
- NLTK natural language processing
- JSON data storage
- Python automation
methods:
- AI/ML-specific document preprocessing and semantic chunking
- Extractive and abstractive summarization using LLMs
- Citation and reference mapping with section-based analysis
- Relationship analysis: direct citations, co-citations, bibliographic coupling
- Batch processing and scalable pipeline automation
- Structured metadata extraction and caching for efficient retrieval
results: Successfully integrated semantic chunking, summarization, and citation linking
  across 200+ papers, reducing literature review time by over 80% and enabling automated
  generation of structured survey drafts.
impact: Empowered researchers to perform faster, deeper literature analysis with AI
  assistance, improving comprehensiveness and accuracy of academic surveys.
duration: 8 months

source_text: 'I developed LitBot, an AI-powered literature survey assistant that helps
  researchers efficiently manage and analyze academic papers. The system provides
  intelligent paper search, summarization, citation management, and advanced relationship
  analysis with sophisticated AI/ML-specific preprocessing, semantic chunking, and
  reference mapping capabilities. Key features include: intelligent paper search with
  automatic metadata extraction, AI-generated paper summaries with structured output
  for methodology, datasets, and results, comprehensive reference mapping with section-based
  citation analysis, enhanced relationship analysis including direct citations, co-citations,
  and bibliographic coupling, and batch processing automation for entire libraries.
  The system uses OpenAI GPT models for summarization, FAISS for vector search, PyMuPDF
  for PDF processing, and NLTK for text chunking. It processes papers to extract detailed
  information including paper type, key findings, methodology, datasets, model architectures,
  main results, limitations, and practical implications. The project includes a comprehensive
  data management system with JSON storage, efficient caching, and robust error handling.'
