title: 'LitBot: AI Literature Survey Assistant'
slug: litbot
description: Developed LitBot, a production-grade hybrid Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for large-scale literature analysis. Implements multi-index retrieval (dense + sparse), structured IR, metadata-aware filtering, and cross-paper reasoning to enable ML-focused semantic search and automated survey synthesis across 200+ research papers.
role: Developer
technologies:
- Python 3.9+
- OpenAI GPT models
- SentenceTransformers
- FAISS (dense vector retrieval)
- BM25 (sparse keyword retrieval)
- PyMuPDF PDF processing
- NLTK / custom sentence splitting
- SQLite (metadata indexing)
- Flask dashboard
- JSON artifact storage
methods:
- Designed glass-box RAG architecture: PDF → Canonical Structured IR → Section-aware Chunking → Multi-Index Retrieval → Evidence-based Summarization
- Implemented hybrid retrieval combining dense semantic embeddings (FAISS) with sparse lexical ranking (BM25) for precision-controlled search
- Built deterministic chunking pipeline with sentence-boundary safety and automated validators
- Developed structured entity extraction (methods, datasets, metrics) and claim categorization for cross-paper comparative analysis
- Engineered metadata-aware filtering layer to enforce structured query constraints before LLM generation
- Implemented citation graph and relationship analysis (direct citations, co-citations, bibliographic coupling)
- Created evaluation harness to measure retrieval quality (precision@k / recall@k)
results: Successfully processed and indexed 200+ research papers into a multi-index retrieval system, enabling sub-second hybrid search, structured cross-paper comparison, and automated generation of evidence-backed literature summaries.
impact: Demonstrates applied ML systems engineering capability through hybrid retrieval design, structured information extraction, and evaluation-driven RAG development—directly aligned with Machine Learning Engineer and Applied AI roles.

source_text: 'I developed LitBot, an AI-powered literature survey assistant that helps
  researchers efficiently manage and analyze academic papers. The system provides
  intelligent paper search, summarization, citation management, and advanced relationship
  analysis with sophisticated AI/ML-specific preprocessing, semantic chunking, and
  reference mapping capabilities. Key features include: intelligent paper search with
  automatic metadata extraction, AI-generated paper summaries with structured output
  for methodology, datasets, and results, comprehensive reference mapping with section-based
  citation analysis, enhanced relationship analysis including direct citations, co-citations,
  and bibliographic coupling, and batch processing automation for entire libraries.
  The system uses OpenAI GPT models for summarization, FAISS for vector search, PyMuPDF
  for PDF processing, and NLTK for text chunking. It processes papers to extract detailed
  information including paper type, key findings, methodology, datasets, model architectures,
  main results, limitations, and practical implications. The project includes a comprehensive
  data management system with JSON storage, efficient caching, and robust error handling.'
